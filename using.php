		<h1>Acquiring and Transfering Monero</h1>
		
		<h2>Acquiring</h2>
		<p>The most secure way to get Monero is to mine it. This requires large amounts of computing power and time so it is not a good option for most people but <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/mining/">here</a> is a link to the official site for it. If you are you using Tor you can use <a href="http://monerotoruzizulg5ttgat2emf4d6fbmiea25detrmmy7erypseyteyd.onion/get-started/mining/">this link</a> for greater privacy</p>
		<p>The simplest way to acquire Monero is to purchase it from an exchange. Not many exchanges allow you to purchase Monero using a credit/debit card but you can on <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken.</a></p>
		<p>You can use a credit/debit card to purchase Bitcoin on <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a> and then convert it to Monero.</p>
		<p>Another option is to buy Bitcoin on another exchange such as <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> or <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">Local Bitcoins</a> and then transfer it to another exchange.</p>
		
		<h2>Transfering</h2>
		<p>To make a transfer go to the <a href="donate.php">donate</a> page and generate yourself a unique address. Once you have done this you can send your donation to us using the send feature of your wallet. Please note that should not include a payment ID when making the transfer.</p>
